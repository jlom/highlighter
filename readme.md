2017-edition of [Highlighter.no](http://highlighter.no).


## Installation
Most things are NPM-based, so a simple `npm i` should get you most of the way there. But you do need a few global installs as well:

If you're on a Mac running `brew` - this is simple:

```sh
npm i -g imagemin-cli
```


## Build commands
Build: `npm run build`
Build, serve and watch: `npm start`
