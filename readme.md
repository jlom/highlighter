# Highlighter.no
2017-edition of [Highlighter.no](http://highlighter.no).

## Dependencies
I'm on a Mac, so no guarantees that the same things work on Windows, or even other *nix'es.
You're going to need Node and NPM, and Sass. But that's about it.

## Installation
Most things are NPM-based, so a simple `npm i` should get you most of the way there.

## Build commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Build, serve and watch: `npm start`
